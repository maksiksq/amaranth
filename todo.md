//
- [ ] A MUSIC DISC
- [ ] Completely unsolicited dani reference because i felt nostalgic
- 
- [ ] mc tree maker framework or something because it's kinda pain
- [ ] framework for turn nbt into placed feature gen
- [ ] a mod that makes players edible
- [ ] a minecraft biome and terrablender biome guide, no one has to suffer through this shit again

- [ ] FIX IMPORTANT: FILL BIOME RANGES (e.g. oceans) ; the one image that explains terrablender says to fill them fully but that sounds horrific, i'll have to recreate vanilla? no thank u, unless im misunderstanding something i'd just fill in oceans with ocean which would make vanilla oceans a bit more boring but prevent my biomes from spawning in them 

- [x] fix: deprecated petal cutout renderer
- [ ] maybe fix: silver birch detached check is a bit loose but you do only get a few saplings here and there per biome so it's ok for now
- [ ] fix: maybe try fixing the grass color for silver birch again??
- [x] fix: silver birch has grass inside
- [x] fix: use a placed feature instead of a structure because why again
- [x] add more creative mod tabs ; just sorted the one tab i have
- [x] fix: fountains generate with grass corners
- [x] fix: dusty biome
- [ ] finish: shrooms
- [ ] maybe marble columns and etc.
- [ ] actually put marble in somewhere
- [x]  RegionUtils.getVanillaParameterPoints(Biomes.RIVER); omg
- [ ]  report VanillaParameterOverlayBuilder mob spawn issue if it's still a thing in 1.21.9
- [x]  find workaround to keep shroomboi spawning ; maybe keep at monster/ambient for now ; terrablender's builder let's go
- [x]  !!! make surface rules not generate stuff underground ; find some way to copy vanilla !!!
- [x]  distribute the biomes with a fresh (balder) head ; im gonna die this is so funny
- [x]  add overrides to terrablender's builder for exceptions
- [x]  fix: desolate biome effects should not work underground

- [x] distribute biome rarity w regions ; also make them not spawn too high ; silver birch seems to not generate like at all rn

- [x] music
-------------------------
- [x] compose some music for the trailer 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srhTqupfGyQ 8:45 sounds like it'd fit really well maybe i could use it as inspiration
--------------------

- [x] Mystic biome
-------------------------
- [x] Arcane Hysteria tree. And some sorta mystic biome. The vibe is kind of eerie, unsettling. "Some say the souls still scream even when sawed into planks. This is, of course, untrue! *Probably*."
- [ ] Implement bushes 
- [ ] Wizard tower as a structure
- [ ] make hexfruit modify the player's health instead of an effect ; or a custom effect, makes more sense because it has a timer ; actually vanilla does 2 hearts if you don't pass an amplifier already, convenient ; still would be cool as a custom effect to stack with other mods
- [x] brush up door texture
- [x] make amethysts spawn on the ground

//

- [x] dark fog (neo has an event?)
- [x] permanent snowstorm
- [x] wind ambience
- [x] add powdery snow, and rarely at that to cause as much pain as possible
- [x] bury the heart somehow
- [x] structure with a lamp and a direction sign saying something a la "lost" or "undefined"
- [ ] maybe: I could make the wind direction server side so it can be synced between people but kind too minor of a thing
- [ ] maybe fix: technically it never actually snows with snow layers which is kinda lame but also whatever
- [ ] maybe fix: place snow layers on top of powdered snow
- [ ] shaders eat fog
