- [ ] A MUSIC DISC
- [ ] Completely unsolicited dani reference because i felt nostalgic

//

- [ ] Mystic biome
-------------------------
- [ ] Arcane Hysteria tree. And some sorta mystic biome. The vibe is kind of eerie, unsettling. "Some say the souls still scream even when sawed into planks. This is, of course, untrue! *Probably*."
- [ ] Implement bushes 
- [ ] Wizard tower as a structure (ask miwa?)
- [ ] force miwa to make me concepts
- [ ] make hexfruit modify the player's health instead of an effect ; or a custom effect, makes more sense because it has a timer ; actually vanilla does 2 hearts if you don't pass an amplifier already, convenient ; still would be cool as a custom effect to stack with other mods
- [ ] brush up door texture

//

- [ ] Spiky desert
-------------------------
- [ ] Big ahh spikes of like cool blocks


//

- [ ] some wonky birch biome because hate 
-------------------------

- [ ] double down on fireflies
- [ ] but funky not just that trailer

//

### just a good forest biome or three

-------------------------

- [ ] maple forests
- [ ] larch forest or smth spiny 
- [ ] deserts but fun (like dry)
-------------------------

//

### just a good shrubland or two

-------------------------

- [ ] something very dead
- [ ] something not very dead
-------------------------
