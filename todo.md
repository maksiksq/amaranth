//
- [x] A MUSIC DISC
- [ ] Completely unsolicited dani reference because i felt nostalgic ; milk
- 
- [x] mc tree maker framework or something because it's kinda pain
- [ ] unrelated but make like an actually good color picker website cuz im annoyed
- [ ] framework for turn nbt into placed feature gen ; place like fossils do, plus already exists 
- [ ] a mod that makes players edible
- [ ] a minecraft biome and terrablender biome guide, no one has to suffer through this shit again ; also make it an example mod ; !!!

- [x] FIX IMPORTANT: FILL BIOME RANGES (e.g. oceans) ; the one image that explains terrablender says to fill them fully but that sounds horrific, i'll have to recreate vanilla? no thank u, unless im misunderstanding something i'd just fill in oceans with ocean which would make vanilla oceans a bit more boring but prevent my biomes from spawning in them ; terrablender builder
- [x] fix: deprecated petal cutout renderer
- [ ] maybe fix: silver birch detached check is a bit loose but you do only get a few saplings here and there per biome so it's ok for now. ; it adds to the biome
- [ ] fix: maybe try fixing the grass color for silver birch again??
- [x] fix: silver birch has grass inside
- [x] fix: use a placed feature instead of a structure because why again
- [x] add more creative mod tabs ; just sorted the one tab i have
- [x] fix: fountains generate with grass corners
- [x] fix: dusty biome
- [ ] finish: shrooms
- [ ] maybe marble columns and etc.
- [ ] actually put marble in somewhere
- [x]
- [ ]  report VanillaParameterOverlayBuilder mob spawn issue if it's still a thing in 1.21.9
- [x]  find workaround to keep shroomboi spawning ; maybe keep at monster/ambient for now ; terrablender's builder let's go
- [x]  !!! make surface rules not generate stuff underground ; find some way to copy vanilla !!!
- [x]  distribute the biomes with a fresh (balder) head ; im gonna die this is so funny
- [x]  add overrides to terrablender's builder for exceptions
- [x]  fix: desolate biome effects should not work underground
- [x]  redistribute the biomes according to the annotation
- [ ]  do a 50/50 on some biomes if that would work reasonably ??? ; couldnt with current terrablender rip ; on my Christmas wishlist 
- [ ]  melon helmet
- [ ]  finish: pumpkin
- [ ]  fix: unchecked operation somewhere
- [ ]  fix: maybe use offset to prevent patchiness? ; no
- [x]  fix: logs not stripping
- [ ]  fix: potted blocks for saplings
- [ ]  fix: try to make a 50/50 replace later again ; !
- [ ]  fix: make disc obtainable ; any loot table chest? ; or dungeons
- [x]  fix: i can make freaking WATERFALLS
- [ ]  fix: do some profiling to make sure i didnt add any performance pitfalls
- [x]  fix: anthocyanin should spawn near jungle
- [ ]  fix: add teaser hut structure
- [x]  fix: later rework foliage places to be more sensible
- [x]  fix: dont forget the waterfalls ewew
- [ ]  TODO: IMPORTANT: maybe if i can pull it off this time, add biome replacements, so it's 50% to back to the vanilla biome, why? because they all keep spawning in the same region, this is one way to solve the problem of all biomes being clumped together in the region, give each a 50/50 vanilla alternative and in turn just make it rarer
- [ ]  TRAILER: -5621453417704106832  -291172 158 5765  screenshottable as hell
- [ ]  look into isSolid
- [ ]  make mod to make leaf litter and etc replaceable if it's not a thing on later versions


- [x] distribute biome rarity w regions ; also make them not spawn too high ; silver birch seems to not generate like at all rn

- //

- [x] music

- [x] Mystic biome
-------------------------
- [x] Arcane Hysteria tree. And some sorta mystic biome. The vibe is kind of eerie, unsettling. "Some say the souls still scream even when sawed into planks. This is, of course, untrue! *Probably*."
- [ ] Implement bushes 
- [ ] Wizard tower as a structure
- [ ] make hexfruit modify the player's health instead of an effect ; or a custom effect, makes more sense because it has a timer ; actually vanilla does 2 hearts if you don't pass an amplifier already, convenient ; still would be cool as a custom effect to stack with other mods
- [x] brush up door texture
- [x] make amethysts spawn on the ground

//

- [x] wind ambience
- [x] add powdery snow, and rarely at that to cause as much pain as possible

- [x] structure with a lamp and a direction sign saying something a la "lost" or "undefined"
- [ ] maybe: I could make the wind direction server side so it can be synced between people but kind too minor of a thing
- [ ] maybe fix: technically it never actually snows with snow layers which is kinda lame but also whatever
- [ ] maybe fix: place snow layers on top of powdered snow
- [ ] shaders eat fog

tutorial:
- for swamps vanilla doesnt use the arrays
- a small amount of regions is why BWG gen looks so fragmented
- no region blending lame
- all ways to do this
- separate article to just replace a biome/tweaks
- replacing the biome wont replace variants unless asked to
- snowcapped
- what each point does
- all the other biome gen stuff
