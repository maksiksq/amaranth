- [ ] Mystic biome
-------------------------
- [x] Arcane Hysteria tree. And some sorta mystic biome. The vibe is kind of eerie, unsettling. "Some say the souls still scream even when sawed into planks. This is, of course, untrue! *Probably*."
- [ ] Implement bushes 
- [ ] Wizard tower as a structure
- [ ] ask miwa to make concepts?
- [ ] make hexfruit modify the player's health instead of an effect ; or a custom effect, makes more sense because it has a timer ; actually vanilla does 2 hearts if you don't pass an amplifier already, convenient ; still would be cool as a custom effect to stack with other mods
- [x] brush up door texture
- [x] make amethysts spawn on the ground
