- [ ] Mystic biome
-------------------------
- [ ] Arcane Hysteria tree. And some sorta mystic biome. The vibe is kind of eerie, unsettling. "Some say the souls still scream even when sawed into planks. This is, of course, untrue! *Probably*."
- [ ] Implement bushes 
- [ ] Wizard tower as a structure (ask miwa?)
- [ ] force miwa to make me concepts
- [x] make hexfruit modify the players health instead of an effect ; or a custom effect, makes more sense because it has a timer ; actually vanilla does 2 hearts if you don't pass an amplifier already, convenient
